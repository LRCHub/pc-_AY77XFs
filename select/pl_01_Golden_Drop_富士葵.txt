Sugar melts. English breakfast, like a thin line
One drop I know
One drop I know
One drop I know
One per step, I go, still slow
作りかけのリリックと
足並みを揃えて
確かに歩いていく。
イメージは、La la la la…
Inside my cup of milk
To that golden drop, one drip
One thread that's tied to you

歩んできたよ
Sugar melts, English breakfast, quiet, low, like
a thin line
One drop I know
One per step, I go
One drop I know
One per step, I go
Awakens me, falling light. Spun ring spoon,

One drop I know
One per step, I go
One drop I know
One per step, I go, still slow
For you
One per step, I go, still slow
One per step, I go, slow
こんなありふれた僕の歩幅じゃ
きっと未来なんて変わらないんだろうな
それでもひとつずつ
その波、感じながら
落としてゆくdrop drop …
Each drop still carries me on
Each drop still carries me on
君の紅茶に掛ける魔法
Ever-low, fragili fragili fragili steps
Sugar melts, English breakfast, quiet, low, like
a thin line
One drop I know
One per step, I go
One drop I know
One per step, I go
Awakens me, falling light. Spun ring spoon,
rippling voices
One drop I know
One per step, I go
One drop I know
One per step, I go, slow
落とす
Just a spoonful of sugar helps
This medicine goes down-wown
Just a spoonful of sugar helps
This medicine goes down-wown
小さな甘さ感じて。
More than an empty cup and spoon, I've been
